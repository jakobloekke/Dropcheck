Dropcheck
=========

Dropcheck is a web app that runs out of your Dropbox public folder.

It turns a simple .txt file into a mobile checklist.

How to install
--------------
1. Put the "Dropcheck" folder in your Dropbox public folder.
3. Access the public link of "dropcheck.htm" through mobile Safari.
4. Bookmark the page to your iPhone homescreen.

Known issues
------------
Windows users need to manually save the .txt file with UTF-8 encoding in Notepad. 
Otherwise international characters will look funny ...

TODOs / Ideas
----

* Add indication of wether data is coming from localstorage - probably this should be presented near the "reset to Dropbox link"
* Fix handling of international characters
* Add handling of multiple lists
