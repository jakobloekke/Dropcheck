How to install
==============

1. Put the "DropCheck" folder in your Dropbox public folder.
2. Right-click "dropcheck.htm" and get the Dropboc public link.
3. Access the link through Safari on your iPhone.
4. Adding a bookmark to your homescreen will install DropCheck as a web-based app - complete with icon and startup splash screen.
5. Edit dropcheck-list.txt in your Dropbox folder and watch it magically turn into a checklist on your iPhone.
6. Have fun!

Note for Windows users:
You need to manually save the text file with UTF-8 encoding, if you use Notepad. Otherwise international characters will look funny ...
